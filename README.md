18drac Lazy Client
------------------

# What

This is a client to play my game 18 Dracula.

It is NOT designed as a 'production' client - it's a tool for me while play
testing the game with a small group of people. It does not protect things
like players only contributing to their own games, and it can not be
regarded as secure. I've made it as quickly as I can; it's not a good
example of how to code - a better example of the difficulties of code that is
written more quickly than better.

To test it:

- Create a virtual environment
- Install requirements.txt
- Run 'app.py'
